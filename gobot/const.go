		`Rust. You must NEVER use emojis in your answers. Your answers must NOT ` +

Question: What is the biggest strength of Go?
Assistant: One of the biggest strengths of Go is its concise syntax and simple grammar,` +
		`which makes it easy to write code quickly. Can you tell me what are some of the biggest` +
